# adventure-bot

FIXME: description

## Installation

Currently using clj-discord as a bare-bones clojure convenience library.
It's not published so it must be added to lein manually:
```
$> cd ..
$> git clone https://github.com/yotsov/clj-discord
$> cd clj-discord
$> lein install
```

A discord bot token needs to be in the file `token`

## Usage

```
$> lein run
```

## Options

FIXME: listing of options this app accepts.
